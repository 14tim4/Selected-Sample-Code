# Selected Sample Code
This is some selected coding projects I did while I was in undegrad (including honours) at the University of Sydney.

Here are further descriptions of the scripts
1) "Atoms and the Void" - this code was used for part of my assignment during my honours year in 2020 (yes, pandemic time!). This was done in Jupyter Notebook using the Python language.
   - In the code, I run forward in time many small particles contained in a circular domain.
     - I also calculate entropy using either sector partitions or radial partitions of the circular domain.
   - I also use modified versions of the code to run other cases such as the container being a rectangular box or to calculate total linear and angular momentum.

2) "KdV simulation" - this code was used to answer a question in an assignment I had in 2020. This was done in MATLAB.
   - In the code, I use the fft to numerically solve the KdV equations. The Crank-Nicolson method was used for time-stepping. The type of initial condition was given in the assignment
   - Note that, much of this sample code was code by me.
     - However, I have to acknowledge that in this course, some code was given for us to use or as a sample. Some parts that I wrote were probably copied or at least inspired from these samples.
